You can easily download an evaluation version of Aspose.Imaging for Java from the [download page](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.imaging-for-java/default.aspx). The evaluation version provides the same capabilities as the licensed version of the component. Furthermore, evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you purchase a license and add a couple of lines of code to apply the license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.Imaging (that is, the component running without a license applied) provides full Imaging functionality but it shows an evaluation watermark on the processed images and restrict the usage of core imaging features.

If you want to try Aspose.Imaging without evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](http://www.aspose.com/corporate/purchase/temporary-license.aspx) for more information.
